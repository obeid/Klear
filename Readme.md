## Klear: a Clear clone (todo app)


Klear is a TIY homework assignment that utilizes Backbone as the MV* framework of choice.

It was my first attempt to use Backbone, templating was done using handlebarsjs and dynamic colot generation was done using some Sass trickery. You only need to change the 'root' color for everything else to change.

```
git clone git@github.com:obeid/Klear.git
npm install && bower install
gulp watch
```
